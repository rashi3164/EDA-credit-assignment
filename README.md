# EDA-credit-assignment
This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their  installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the  amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure  that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such  applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
To identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be 
used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky 
applicants) at a higher interest rate
Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
• If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of 
business to the company
• If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the 
loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
